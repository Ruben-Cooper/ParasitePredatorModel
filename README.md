# ðŸŒ±Ecological Dynamics: Predator-Prey Simulation Project

This project, developed by Group 16 for MXB261 @ QUT, is a comprehensive exploration of a predator-prey model using various simulation and sampling methods. The primary focus is on understanding the dynamic relationship between parasites (predators) and their food (prey) through mathematical modeling and simulation techniques.

## Introduction

The Parasite Model is a system of two Ordinary Differential Equations representing a predator-prey relationship. Our analysis includes various simulation methods, parameter sweeps, and equilibrium analysis to understand the model's behavior under different conditions.

## Features

-   **Explicit Euler Method Simulation:** For fixed parameters.
    
-   **ODE45 Simulation:** MATLAB's built-in function for solving ordinary differential equations.
    
-   **Parameter Sweep:** Investigating the impact of varying parameters on the system's behavior.
    
-   **Equilibrium Analysis:** Determining steady-state solutions for different parameter values.
    
-   **Latin Hypercube and Orthogonal Sampling:** Comprehensive exploration of parameter space in 2D and 3D.
    

## Methods

1.  **Task 1:**
    
    -   Simulated using the Explicit Euler Method and ODE45.
        
    -   Conducted parameter sweeps for specific rates of food growth and decay.
        
    -   Analyzed scenarios where the system reaches equilibrium or becomes unstable.
        
2.  **Task 2:**
    
    -   Employed Latin Hypercube Sampling to explore the parameter space in 2D.
        
    -   Examined the conditions under which the parasite population thrives or diminishes.
        
3.  **Task 3:**
    
    -   Investigated system dynamics over three parameters.
        
    -   Compared Latin Hypercube Sampling and Orthogonal Sampling methods.
        
4.  **Task 4:**
    
    -   Conducted spatial stochastic agent-based simulations.
        
    -   Explored the impact of initial population density and placement on system behavior.
        

## Results

-   Detailed analysis of equilibrium points and system stability.
    
-   Insights into the relationship between parameter variations and model behavior.
    
-   Comparative analysis of sampling methods in high-dimensional parameter spaces.
